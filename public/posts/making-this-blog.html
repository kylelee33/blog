          <p class="card-content">Feb 8, 2019</p>
          <p class="card-content">Hello. My name is Kyle and by no means do I consider myself a blogger of any sort. I'm just a guy who 
              thinks that web development is really cool. Through online bootcamps, Udemy courses, and guidance (help, direction, motivation)
               from a good friend and mentor, my goal for 2019 is to begin a career in web/software development. I've spent the last 7 years 
               in the IT industry, fulfilling roles ranging including desktop support, server administration, and IT management. I've always loved 
               figuring out how things worked and my years in IT certainly helped fulfill that.<br><br>

               Web development is so much fun for me because I get to create something. A tangible website or app, something people can interact with 
               and experience. I think that for many people, their dream job would be to create for a living. Coding is an awesome form of creation that
               I have always been intrigued by, so I've decided to dive in and learn as much as I can. <br><br>

               So why did I even create this blog? My good friend and mentor says "if you can build a blog, you can build pretty much anything". This 
               post was manually coded, but I plan to follow his advice and automate this blog to transform markdown files into HTML pages. It is currently being
               served by a DigitalOcean droplet using express. Wish me luck,
               and thank you for reading.
